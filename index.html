                    <p>Hello!!! I'm Sai Koushik, Chituluri. I did my bachelors in India in Electronics and Communication Engineering later came to States to do my Master’s in computer science at Northern Illinois University. I really enjoyed my time during masters. I got opportunity to work with great professors and people from various parts of the world. In free time I like to watch Netflix, workout, go hiking, running, watch movies. I want to work in a company where I have challenges constantly and collaborative space where co-workers are friendly. I like a challenge that pushes me to think uniquely and so something new. I would like to use my skills to be a part of organization that cares about work-life balance. Everyone I worked with appreciated my leadership skills, I have always been ready to stand up and lead from my childhood. I have been elected as the leader in my school to lead a group and successfully won the sports championship and during my time at Capgemini, I filled in a leadership vacuum when senior developers were not available and lead an offshore team. Below is a detailed look at my employment history. Thanks for taking the time to visit.</p>

        <b>Project 1:</b>  My First project was ITAM Assset conversion where I built Restful applications replacing the MS Access based applications. The work assignment to various roles in the exception managers was very complex due to the various product expertise of business teams and the we had to provide control to the manager to handle the part where managers will be moved from one group to other group temporarily or permanently making sure the manager can exist in multiple groups was challenging. Also, I added a feature where we can generate reports of the distributions.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Project 2:</b> The Second Project I worked is GTM where we provide annuity beneficiary data to other teams via rest. During this part We used a spring boot project where exposed end points for our customers to make restful call to get and post data for beneficiaries.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Project 3:</b> The third project I worked on was a POC. This needs special mention as I was the one who designed it and developed it. The project uses serverless architecture where I used AWS lambda functions to archive files into S3 and used lifecycle policies provided by s3 to move it to glacier.
